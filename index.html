////The final project I would like to make is a board game like candy land or chess. 

 I will try to use react site that just makes the board start first. If I am able find a tutorial for a board type system. 
 Seeing if I can get it to interact with the other squares. 
 Then just make it so the chess piece or other game pieces can move and hit each other. 
 If I go with this type of game I need to color both the tiles for the board. 
 I also need to color the board a distinct color. This will help the player be able to tell where on board there are. 
 There also needs to be timer keeping element if I go with chess. 
 The need for this is because the other player can just sit there without playing. 
 This will be turn based two player game without a need for an AI. 
 They will play a turn that lasts 5 mins each for both games both chess and candy land. The player after there turn ends they will take card for candy land. 
 There will be a way for the players to take cards or chess pieces. The need for dump place for used cards or chess pieces. 
 If the player losses there maybe be a sad song or loser song that plays. That says player 2 has loss or forfeit. 
 There should be a forfeit button if the other player is not having fun. There also should be a way for the person to be sent back to a space or two. 
 It must be on board if they hit some type of obstacle. Like the black pudding swamp or card sent back to the next orange space on the board.
